# Simple Parallax
'Blog Hero' parallax effect - I watched [DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/c/devtipsfordesigners) for got inspired by this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwoa-9jxi0&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IyCbhul-PdeiDqmh4ooJzk) to make a quick blog style hero section that used the parallax effect.
This is a super simple example of an idea I had for a blog page.

I'll admit that the structure is sloppy, but basically this project is built in CodeKit and everything should compile to the _site folder. I'll also admit i havent spent much time on it.
